# Movie Analysis with Bechdel Test and IMDb Data

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks analyzing various aspects of movies based on Bechdel test scores and IMDb ratings. The analyses aim to explore trends and correlations in women's representation in movies across different dimensions.

## Notebooks

1. **[Trends in Women's Representation Over Time](Trends_in_Womens_Representation_Over_Time.ipynb)**

   - This notebook analyzes how the representation of women in movies (based on Bechdel test scores) has changed over the decades.

2. **[Genre Analysis](Genre_Analysis.ipynb)**

   - This notebook compares Bechdel test scores across different genres to see which genres tend to have better or worse representation of women.

3. **[Impact of Women's Representation on IMDb Ratings](Impact_of_Womens_Representation_on_IMDb_Ratings.ipynb)**

   - This notebook investigates whether there is a correlation between a movie's Bechdel test score and its IMDb rating.

4. **[Analyzing Women's Representation and Movie Length](Analyzing_Womens_Representation_and_Movie_Length.ipynb)**

   - This notebook analyzes whether women's representation, as measured by the Bechdel test scores, is proportional to the movie's length.

5. **[Analyzing Sexism in Sci-Fi Movies](Analyzing_Sexism_in_Sci_Fi_Movies.ipynb)**
   - This notebook analyzes whether sci-fi movies are more likely to have lower scores on the Bechdel test compared to movies of other genres.

## Data

The dataset used in these analyses contains information about more than 9000 movies, including their titles, genres, IMDb ratings, and scores on the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test, invented by Alison Bechdel in 1985, measures women's representation in movies. To pass the test, a film must have:

1. At least two named women characters,
2. Who talk to each other,
3. About something other than a man.

The dataset is updated monthly and includes movies released from 1894 to 2024.
